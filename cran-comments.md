================
Thank you for checking this submission. The following notes I was unable to remove, but they pose no issues for the running of the package

# From devtools::check_win_release()

1. Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  IntraClass (2:8, 19:14)

IntraClass Effect Decomposition is the name of the method this package runs, so IntraClass is not misspelled here. 

# From devtools::check_rhub()
