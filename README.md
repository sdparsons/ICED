# ICED helper functions

so far I have a pilot version of a function `iced_syntax` that I am working on.


To do

The function needs to be able to introduce some constrained models, e.g. setting true score variance to 0, or session error variance to zero. 

Also, I want to write further functions that can extract ICED related information from the lavaan output.
